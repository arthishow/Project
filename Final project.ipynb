    "This notebook aims at giving technical explanations necessary to understand how the results given in the final report were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, the following commands allow you to retrieve the data necessary to run this notebook locally from the cluster used for this class.\n",
    "1. Upload the files script.sh and script.py using the following command:  \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "scp -r -p /path/to/script.py GASPAR@iccluster028.iccluster.epfl.ch:/home/GASPAR/script.py  \n",
    "scp -r -p /path/to/script.sh GASPAR@iccluster028.iccluster.epfl.ch:/home/GASPAR/script.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Connect to the cluster using a second terminal and run the scripts:  \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "ssh GASPAR@iccluster028.iccluster.epfl.ch  \n",
    "sh script.sh script.py  \n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Store the output in the home folder:  \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "hadoop fs -get /user/GASPAR/politics_2016_* file:///home/GASPAR\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Download the data locally:  \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "scp -r GASPAR@iccluster028.iccluster.epfl.ch:/home/GASPAR/politics_2016_* /local/path/to/folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of several different features listed below:\n",
    "* **author**: The username of the author of the comment.\n",
    "* **author_flair_text**: Users can pick so-called *flairs* which are basically tags intended to briefly summarize the user.  They're different for each subreddit, and users can only pick one per subreddit.\n",
    "* **body**: The content of the comment.\n",
    "* **created_utc**: The date at which the comment was originally posted.\n",
    "* **gilded**: Denotes if the comment received a gold. A gold is a form of gratification users can give another. They're not common because gilding someone costs money.\n",
    "* **link_id**: A unique ID that determines the post in which the comment was posted to.\n",
    "* **parent_id**: A unique ID that determines to what the comment is responding to. If it starts with *t1*, the comment is a response to another comment. If it starts with *t3*, the comment is responding directly to the original post.\n",
    "* **score**: The number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes the comment received.\n"
